The Indian Budget 2024 sparked widespread inter- ests and public discussions on social-media platforms such as Twitter. Despite the significance of such time-sensitive and nation-specific events, much research has not been devoted to get a comprehensive understanding of such events. This study aims to address this gap by implementing advanced sentiment classification models and topic modelling on the Indian Budget 2024. ‘Budget 2024 Tweets’ dataset is created with more than 4500 budget-related tweets, which are each annotated with any one of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The tweets are extensively cleaned and pre-processed. Both traditional and deep learning models were used in sentiment classification, wherein DistilBERT performed the best with 81 percentage accuracy followed by MLP with 74 percentage accuracy. Non- negative matrix factorisation was used for topic modelling where 6 key topics of discussion were identified. This study concludes that the framework introduced can be implemented for similar socio-economic events to provide policy makers with overall public sentiment and key issues.
